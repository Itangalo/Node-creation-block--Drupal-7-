The Form Block module for Drupal (http://drupal.org/project/formblock) allows
displaying user registration forms, node forms and some other forms in blocks.
Unfortunately it was not available for Drupal 7 at the time of writing, which
prompted me to write this module.

It provides one block for each node type, displaying the node type's creation
form. It respects user permissions, meaning that it will not display the
creation form if you are not allowed to create the node.

The module was created to allow using nodes as contact forms in Drupal 7. I have
no plans on spending very much time on this module – have a look at Form Block
if you want a long-term solution.

Cheers!
